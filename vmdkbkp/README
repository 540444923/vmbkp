Description of directories.

test:
  Source code of unit tests.

How to build.
*******************************************************************************

Required platform:
    Currently Linux OS for x86_64 host is supported.
    Recommended distribution is CentOS 5.5.
    (This may work in 32bit environment also but not tested yet.)

Required compiler:
    g++ 4.4 or above version.
    Previous versions may work well but I have not tested them.

Required libraries:
    VDDK (VMware Disk Development Kit) 1.2.0 provided by VMware, Inc.
    FUSE (install fuse-libs packages for CentOS) required by VDDK.
    OpenSSL 0.9.8 or above version.
    Boost 1.43 or above version.
      (shared_ptr, scoped_array, thread, and iostreams).

Required tools to build documents:
    doxygen 1.4.7 or avobe version.

Build steps:
1. Install VDDK (VMware-vix-disklib) library in your system.
  You can get library tarball
    like VMware-vix-disklib-1.2.0-230216.x86_64.tar.gz
    from VMware, Inc (http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vddk/).
  If you specify /usr/local as install directory,
    almost files are installed under /usr/local/lib/vmware-vix-disklib.
  Set environmental variables as follows:
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/vmware-vix-disklib/lib64

2. Afterall, cd 'src' directory and type just 'make'.
   then libraries and executables will be created.
   See Makefile for more details.
   For documents, 'make doc' will generate API documents
   in api_doc directory.

3. Install executables to your favolite directry.
   cd 'src' and type make install PREFIX=XXXXX
   Executables will be installed in XXXXX/bin directory.

Executables and libraries
*******************************************************************************

vmdkbkp:
    Vmdk file backup tool for VMware vSphere.
    Supported commands:
        dump, restore, print, check, merge, digest, (rdiff).

check_dump_and_dump: 
    Check two dump files have the same contents.
    
check_digest_and_digest:
    Check two digest files have the same digest data. 

print_bmp:
    Print changed block bitmap file in human-readable format.

rdiff2bmp:
    Generate changed block bitmap from rdiff file.
    This is just for test. Originally changed block bitmap file 
    is created with the information from the vSphere soap server.

libvmdkbkp.so: 
    Utility components. Lay it out in the same directory as executables.

*******************************************************************************
Usage

check_dump_and_dump:
    check_dump_and_dump dump1 dump2

check_digest_and_digest:
    check_digest_and_digest digest1 digest2

print_bmp:
    print_bmp < bitmap

rdiff2bmp:
